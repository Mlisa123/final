<h2>About Us</h2>
    
	<p>Northwest Peacock Care was started by M’Lisa Hartzell, who grew up on a farm in Nebraska and has always loved animals. While on vacation, she discovered peacocks and was instantly hooked—not just because they’re beautiful, but also because of how friendly and useful they are. Peacocks help with natural pest control, can act as great watchdogs thanks to their loud calls, and even deter snakes and rodents. Peacocks are social animals that bond with their owner and other pets. </p>
<br />
 <p>Now living in Idaho’s Treasure Valley, I have started Northwest Peacock Care to help others enjoy the unique experience of raising peafowl. They can seem a little intimidating at first, so we've made it easy by offering everything from pen design and setup help to care plans, nutrition advice, and supplies.
